## 🔍 Critical Reflection

Creating this dashboard was not only a technical exercise but a **strategic challenge** in designing **human-centered analytics**. I approached this task through the lens of:

1. **Business Value Alignment**: Each visual element serves a specific stakeholder need—either strategic (long-term trends) or operational (daily performance metrics).
2. **Model Optimization**: Data modeling followed the star schema best practices ensuring fast DAX query performance.
3. **User Experience Design**: I balanced cognitive load and aesthetic appeal, enabling insights without overwhelming the user.
4. **Scalability**: The report design is modular, supporting plug-and-play integration with larger enterprise systems.
